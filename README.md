# metaform

Metaform is a module and CLI tool for generating Terraform files in Python.  See `examples/metaform_example.tf.py` for an example script that shows basic functionality.  The Terraform file `examples/metaform_example.tf` is the output Terraform file generated by running the example script.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run
```shell
python3 setup.py develop
```
to build the module and enable the CLI.

## How to Use

Once you have metaform installed on your machine and you've written a metaform script in Python, you can generate the Terraform file(s) by calling the `.build()` method of your Metaform class.  To enable automated generation for Metaform scripts, you can use the CLI command
```shell
mf
```
to build all scripts in the current directory with a `.tf.py` extension.  If you want to build all scripts in a specific directory, simply use
```shell
mf --chdir ./directory_to_search
```

## Planned Work

Now that there is a minimal working version, the next work planned is to create a Metaform module that allows you to read parameterized Metaform code from local files or GitHub repositories and execute it.
